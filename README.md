**Intro**

This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Technologies**

HTML5, CSS (BEM,flexbox,grid, responsive-web-design)

**Breskpoints Used**

- 1280px and higher
- from 768px to 1280px
- from 425px to 768x
- from 320px to 425px
- up to 320px

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
